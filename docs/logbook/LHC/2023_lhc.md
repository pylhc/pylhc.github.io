<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Ions Optics commissioning 14/07]:  Supposed to be validation of previous correction. Knobs had not been properly incorporated. Found that LHCB had been done last time with wrong model (ADT instead of ACD). Global corrections redone. Checked xing angle impact on beta-beat. Measurements of coupling feed-down in IP2 for b3 correction.
*[13/09 Failed ION commissioning]:  Arrived - measurements abandoned due to LHC problems
*[14/09 Failed ION commissioning]:  Arrived - unable to inject for several hours. Beam dump after first few kicks due to magnet trip.
*[Injection Linear Optics]:  Corrections with total phase-advance. DA comparison with MO and chroma (improved!). Injection optics with former (2021) corrections validated, fine corrections for normalized dispersion.
*[Ramp and Squeeze Linear Optics]: Measurements and validation of optics from 200cm down to 30cm, including K-Mod. First new corrections at 120cm, applied from 200cm to 120cm. Bad IP8. All others agree well with corrections from the 2023 MD last year.
*[Measurements in the Ramp + Validation]: Measurements in the Ramp, Validation of 120cm optics with corrections done on 2023-04-05 to lower IP8 beating.
*[a4 Corrections at 30cm]: Measurement of the f1012 and f1210 RDTs and corrections tests at 30cm. Some K-Mod measurement at 87cm.
*[NL Studies at Injection]: Measurement of several RDTs with and without landau octupoles with both 2022 and 2023 optics.
*[Ions Virgin Optics]: Got ions optics to 50cm at IP2. Minor local coupling correction attempted, not very convincing. This is poorly documented in the logbook.
*[Ions Optics Validation]: Implemented new local corrs at IP2. Trimmed energy to be the same as nominal. Calculated global corrections and re-measured for validation.
*[High Beta Optics Validation]: Measured and validated high beta optics (120m). Did some global corrections, beta-beating below 4% in the end. K-mod done but not used.
*[MO response at Injection]: Measurements of RDTs with/without global MCO correction for Q'', then measurements at K_MO=+2,-2,-1; then with 2 configs of detuning neutral MO with alternating +/- strengths for the aim of checking impact of detuning on RDT measurement reliability, and to check shift of skew octupole RDT with MO powering.
