# Timeline of LHC Run 3 Measurements in 2025

This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2026 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection, Ramp and Flattop Validation]: Optics at injection, in the ramp and at flat top (1.2m) all good and similar to last year's measurements. Energy measurement showed a small offset for B1 at injection, B2 was limited by kick amplitude. A coupling correction was integrated at 1.8TeV. Had a failure of arc12 sextupoles affecting B2 measurements and forcing a dump.
