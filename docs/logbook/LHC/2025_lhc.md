<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Test of tools. Rephased BPMs. Confirmed local coupling corrections, measured virgin machine at injection optics and did global corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years. First attempts of total phase corrections, used the ones from 2024. First use of new Segment-by-Segment.
*[Coupling Through Squeeze + dE/E]: Checked local coupling and local corrections at 2 m, 1.2 m, 30_60 cm and 18_60 cm (CMS $\beta$x_$\beta$y cm). While at 18_60cm, we attempted dE/E correction to no avail. We also slowly removed the triplet local corrections to see 275 % beta beating, again attempted dE/E correction to no avail. Tested Arc45 bump knobs and arc45+arc81 bump knobs. Tested effectiveness of local coupling knobs from 2024 (by reducing to 95%).  
*[Injection and Ramp]: Arc-by-Arc coupling and global corrections at inj. Tried large amp kicks and failed. Beta-Beating during the ramp. Arc corrections. Global corrections at flat-top (2m).
*[Measurements through the Squeeze]: Recheck 2m; Optics at 1.2m (global corrections, arc-by-arc coupling) taken from 2m work well; Optics at 60cm needs arc-by-arc coupling iteration; Optics at 18cm Kmod, local corrections, new B1 local correction.
*[Energy Shift, NL at 18cm and local iterations]: Checking of Energy Shift. Beta-waist and arc-by-arc coupling at 18cm. b4 corrections at 18cm.
*[NL at injection, IRNL 18cm]: Chroma scans at injection, reference RDT measurements after 8h at inj and with ecloud tunes, arrived at 18cm but dumped soon.
*[IRNL 1.2m and 18cm]: Validated on/off Momentum at 120cm, and 18cm. Checked sdisp qbump, which did not seem to work. Nonlinear corrections at 18cm: b4, a4 (performed and tested) b3, a3 (only measured/calculated).
*[Global Corrs at 60cm and 18cm and Validation]: Tested SDisp knobs and did a first squeeze down to 18cm with global corrections calculated and incorporated at 60cm and 18cm. Beam dumped twice because of IR5. Validation only up to 4.5TeV but also couldn't kick high.
*[Validation of Everything]: Validated 120cm, 93cm, 60cm, 44cm, 30cm, 24cm, 18cm. Too many k-mods. Waistshift and beta*-beating at 18cm. Tried to find better corrections, but dumped before verifying.
*[Ion Optics Part 1]: Validation of ion optics, injection, ramp flattop. Ramp AC-Dipole issues in Beam1. Corrections (aba-coupling, global) at 50cm/100cm.
*[Ion Optics Part 2]: Ramp measurements, with ACD and ADT. Flat-top measurements testing aba-coupling correction from 50cm and IP2 kmod for waist knob. End of squeeze, IP2 waist knob setting, kmod all IPs, testing IP8 waist knob for B1 horizontal.
*[Hierarchy breaking investigation at Injection]: Off-momentum measurements up to +300Hz for chromatic beta-beating. Chromatic coupling correction for B1. At +300Hz measurements with and without MO at 10A. No time available for ion commissioning.
*[Ion Optics Part 3]: Ramp measurements. Corrections improved beta-beating at 6.3TeV. Various issues with TCDQ and BLM in P6, no measurements throught the squeeze.
*[LRBB compensation with flat-optics]: Optics measurements of pilots in B1, in collision with nominals in B2, at 60/18cm. Large beta-beating for the bunch with LR vs the reference. Measurement of sextupole and octupole resonances. Correction of 4Qx and 4Qy from LRBB with MCOX. Correction of 3Qy from LRBB with MCSSX. Measurement with smaller crossing angle and observation of increase in beta-beating for the LRBB bunch.
*[Rematched IR7 optics]: Optics measurements during the ramp and FT, with the rematched IR7 optics. B1 large beta-beating above 4.5TeV and large local phase error in IR7. B2 was ok. New global corrections at flat-top for B1 and validation throught the ramp with a second fill.
