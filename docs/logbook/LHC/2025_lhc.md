# Timeline of LHC Run 3 Measurements in 2025

This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2025 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Test of tools. Rephased BPMs. Confirmed local coupling corrections, measured virgin machine at injection optics and did global corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years. First attempts of total phase corrections, used the ones from 2024. First use of new Segment-by-Segment.
*[Coupling Through Squeeze + dE/E]: Checked local coupling and local corrections at 2 m, 1.2 m, 30_60 cm and 18_60 cm (CMS $\beta$x_$\beta$y cm). While at 18_60cm, we attempted dE/E correction to no avail. We also slowly removed the triplet local corrections to see 275 % beta beating, again attempted dE/E correction to no avail. Tested Arc45 bump knobs and arc45+arc81 bump knobs. Tested effectiveness of local coupling knobs from 2024 (by reducing to 95%).
*[Injection and Ramp]: Arc-by-Arc coupling and global corrections at inj. Tried large amp kicks and failed. Beta-Beating during the ramp. Arc corrections. Global corrections at flat-top (2m).
*[Measurements through the Squeeze]: Recheck 2m; Optics at 1.2m (global corrections, arc-by-arc coupling) taken from 2m work well; Optics at 60cm needs arc-by-arc coupling iteration; Optics at 18cm Kmod, local corrections, new B1 local correction.
*[Energy Shift, NL at 18cm and local iterations]: Checking of Energy Shift. Beta-waist and arc-by-arc coupling at 18cm. b4 corrections at 18cm.
*[NL at injection, IRNL 18cm]: Chroma scans at injection, reference RDT measurements after 8h at inj and with ecloud tunes, arrived at 18cm but dumped soon.
*[IRNL 1.2m and 18cm]: Validated on/off Momentum at 120cm, and 18cm. Checked sdisp qbump, which did not seem to work. Nonlinear corrections at 18cm: b4, a4 (performed and tested) b3, a3 (only measured/calculated).
*[Global Corrs at 60cm and 18cm and Validation]: Tested SDisp knobs and did a first squeeze down to 18cm with global corrections calculated and incorporated at 60cm and 18cm. Beam dumped twice because of IR5. Validation only up to 4.5TeV but also couldn't kick high.
*[Validation of Everything]: Validated 120cm, 93cm, 60cm, 44cm, 30cm, 24cm, 18cm. Too many k-mods. Waistshift and beta-star beating at 18cm. Tried to find better corrections, but dumped before verifying.
*[Pb Ion Optics Part 1]: Validation of ion optics, injection, ramp flattop. Ramp AC-Dipole issues in Beam1. Corrections (aba-coupling, global) at 50cm/100cm.
*[Pb Ion Optics Part 2]: Ramp measurements, with ACD and ADT. Flat-top measurements testing aba-coupling correction from 50cm and IP2 kmod for waist knob. End of squeeze, IP2 waist knob setting, kmod all IPs, testing IP8 waist knob for B1 horizontal.
*[Pb/pO Ion Optics]: Measured in ramp and FT on PbPb cycle as setup for pO. Tested corrections and did Kmod. B1 betabeat brought down to <15% in ramp and improvement to betastar beat at FT. B2 degraded, found new correction at FT which improved betastar beat at IP2 and IP8 as well as waist shift at IP8. Applied pO crossing scheme, found knobs wrongly defined. Fixed. Need another fill for validation.
*[Hierarchy breaking investigation at Injection]: Off-momentum measurements up to +300Hz for chromatic beta-beating. Chromatic coupling correction for B1. At +300Hz measurements with and without MO at 10A. No time available for ion commissioning.
*[pO/Pb ramp validation]: Ramp measurements. Corrections improved beta-beating at 6.3TeV. Various issues with TCDQ and BLM in P6, no measurements throught the squeeze.
*[LRBB compensation with flat-optics]: Optics measurements of pilots in B1, in collision with nominals in B2, at 60/18cm. Large beta-beating for the bunch with LR vs the reference. Measurement of sextupole and octupole resonances. Correction of 4Qx and 4Qy from LRBB with MCOX. Correction of 3Qy from LRBB with MCSSX. Measurement with smaller crossing angle and observation of increase in beta-beating for the LRBB bunch.
*[Rematched IR7 optics]: Optics measurements during the ramp and FT, with the rematched IR7 optics. B1 large beta-beating above 4.5TeV and large local phase error in IR7. B2 was ok. New global corrections at flat-top for B1 and validation throught the ramp with a second fill.
*[MO detuning]: Measurements of amplitude detuning with several settings of the MO, as input to Massimo/Dora's cleaning MD.
*[RDT vs phase knob]: Checked MO RDTs response to phase knob at injection for pp optics, seem to observe improvements with a stronger setting of the phase knob. Difficult measurements due to high losses on kicks.
*[OO Commissioning]: Measured optics in the OO cycle, with PbPb corrections. Optics in ramp were ok, with a match point showing a peak of 17%. At FT the beta-beat and dispersion show a similar quality to that of ions in 2024 and of the 2025 PbPb optics at 1.2m, but large dispersion error on left side of IP6. With PbPb corrections through the squeeze optics are fairly consistent but we see a peak beta-beating of 17% at EoS. SbS hints at large local errors in the IRs at this lower energy. The beta-star-beating at IR2 was very bad at EoS, especially B1. Computed and tested some global corrections which were beneficial to beta-beating, dispersion and beta-star, would need waist knobs to do better. To be decided if these are to be used for the OO run.
*[Valiation of combined ramp/squeeze/rotate]: Measurements during the ramp for combined ramp/squeeze/rotate MD. Standard validation at various points. Optics found to be good throughout the ramp, in line with regular 1.2 and 2m.
*[Refining optics corrections at top energy]: Local chroma at injection wihtout QFB (last point with QFB). ADT-ACD settup in optics mode at injection, 10mm kicks. ADT-ACD at FT, large enough kick to measure linear optics. At FT had problem with BPM concentrator for B1. Local chroma of B2 at 18cm. Kmod at 160 and 120 urad for effect of crossing-scheme on lumi imbalance. Kmod at 120urad with Felix waist knob. Kmod and ACD with 28april waist knob. ACDkicks and xing scan for b6 feed-down to f0140 RDT.
*[Pb Ion Optics Part 3]: Attempted to validate Pb optics with enf of squeeze corrections from last time, as filler during validation of loss maps during vaccuum issue. Quick measurement at injection to check BPMs, but then OP were unable to get cycle to ramp due to inconsistency in ADT settings. Gave up after several hours as LHC switching back to lumi production. Includes summary of previous ion fill results.
*[LRBB Beta-beat compensation with flat-optics]: Tried for the first time to take measurements of the LRBB-optics in both beam-1 and beam-2, using 2 separate fills. No issues encountered when switching the role of weak/strong beams between beam1/2. In Beam1 there was no visible effect on the lifetime. In beam2 however the lifetime appeared to degrade slightly as the MO were removed.
