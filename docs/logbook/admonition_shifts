!!! info "Shift Categorization"

    The letters in the **shifts** column have the following meaning:

    - W = Weekdays (Day)
    - WN = Weekdays (Night)
    - H = Holidays or weekend (Day)
    - HN = Holidays or weekend (Night)

    1 shift consists of an 8h period, so e.g. 0.5W means a 4h shift on a weekday during daytime.

    We consider only the "productive" time for these shifts,
    i.e. time where the machine is in a stable state suitable for measurements,
    this is why the number might be lower than the time difference between start and end.

    Hovering the column name will show a tooltip with more information.
