# The OMC Team

## Overview

The OMC team is part of the ABP group at CERN, in the LNO section.
We are responsible for the measurement and correction of the linear and non-linear accelerator optics in the [LHC][lhc]{target=_blank} as well as other machines is the CERN accelerator complex.
Our meetings can be found on our [Indico page][omc_indico]{target=_blank}.

    This site is currently under construction, and subject to constant change.
    A previous (but poor) documentation used to be the [OMC twiki][omc_twiki]{target=_blank}, and its relevant contents have been transfered here.
