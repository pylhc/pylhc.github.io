# IRNL RDT Correction

[This package][repo] performs local correction of the Resonance Driving Terms (RDTs) in the Insertion Regions (IRs) based on the principle described in [^OBruning] with the addition of correcting feed-down and using feed-down to correct lower order RDTs. Details can be found in [^JDilly].

## Documentation

- [Autogenerated docs][documentation] via ``sphinx``.

## Getting Started

This  package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, and can be installed through `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install irnl-rdt-correction
```

After installing, codes can be run with either `python -m irnl-rdt-correction --FLAG ARGUMENT` or calling path to the `.py` file directly.
