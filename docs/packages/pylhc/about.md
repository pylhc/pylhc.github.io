# PyLHC Tools

[This package][repo] is a collection of useful scripts and tools for the Optics Measurements and Corrections group (OMC) at CERN.
It provides tools which can be useful for working with accelerators, but are not necessary for optics measurements analysis.

## Functionality

- [*Forced DA Analysis*](forced_da.md) - Script to analyse forced DA.
- [*Machine Settings Info*](machine_settings_info.md) - Prints an overview over the machine settings at a given time.
- [*BSRT Logger* and *BSRT Analysis*](bsrt.md) - Saves data coming straight from LHC BSRT FESA class and allows subsequent analysis.
- [*BPM Calibration*](bpm_calibration.md) - Script to compute the calibration factors for the LHC BPMs.
- [*Display Kickgroups*](kickgroups.md) - Script to load kick groups and display relevant information.

## Documentation

- [Autogenerated docs][documentation] via ``sphinx``.

## Getting Started

This  package is `Python 3.7+` compatible, and can be installed through `pip`:

```bash
python -m pip install pylhc
```

After installing, codes can be run with either `python -m pylhc.SCRIPT --FLAG ARGUMENT` or calling path to the `.py` file directly.

Note: similarly to `omc3`, some of the scripts access functionality only available on the CERN Technical Network.
To use those, you should make sure to install the relevant extra dependencies with:

```bash
python -m pip install --index-url http://acc-py-repo.cern.ch:8081/repository/vr-py-releases/simple --trusted-host acc-py-repo.cern.ch "pylhc[cern]"`.
```
