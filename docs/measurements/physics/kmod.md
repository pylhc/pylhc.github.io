# K-Modulation

This section gives a brief overview over the K-Modulation method.
A more detailed description can be found in M. Minty and F. Zimmermann's book[^MintyZimmermann] and the references therein.

Also available on this site is a [checklist for conducting K-Modulation measurements][kmod_procedure] in the LHC.

The full K-Modulation analysis is two-fold:
The [K-Modulation GUI][kmod_gui] is used for LHC measurements, and the following analysis is part of the [`omc3` package][omc3_package].

K-Modulation is a complementary optics measurement method which consists in changing the gradient of a quadrupole and measuring the induced tune variation.
The average $\beta$-function in the modulated quadrupole is linked to the gradient change $\Delta K$ and tune change $\Delta Q_{x,y}$ via[^MintyZimmermann]:

$$
\beta_{x,y} = \pm 2 \Delta K^{-1}\Big[ cot(2 \pi Q_{x,y}) [ 1 - cos(2 \pi \Delta Q_{x,y}) ] + sin(2 \pi \Delta Q_{x,y}) \Big]
$$

If these measurements are conducted for two adjacent quadrupoles, the evolution of the $\beta$-function in-between the modulated quadrupoles can also be inferred[^FelixCarlierKmodPaper].
Here, the average $\beta$-function in the quadrupole is expressed in terms of the optics functions $\beta_0$, $\alpha_0$, and $\gamma_0$ at the end of the quadrupole.

Assuming a drift space between the quadrupoles, these coordinates can then be expressed in terms of the distance of the quadrupole end to the middle of the drift-section $L^*$, the minimum $\beta$-function $\beta^*$, and $w$, the offset of this minimum with respect to the center of the drift.
The length $L^*$ is usually obtained from the machine layout.
Using the two average $\beta$-functions in the quadrupoles, the other two variables $\beta^*$ and $w$ can then be calculated.
The $\beta$-function at other elements in the drift space can then be determined by propagation.

Compared to other methods, K-Modulation allows to infer a potential waist shift and its direction, which is not possible using the turn-by-turn based methods.
However, K-Modulation is usually more time-intensive, and is only applicable with individually powered quadrupoles.
