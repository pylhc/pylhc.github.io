# Harmonic Analysis with Harpy

This page describes how the harmonic analysis is performed with the `harpy` module.
If you want to know how to use the `harpy` module, refer to the [`omc3` analysis workflow][omc3_analysis].

    Explain how harpy works.
    Similar to [Malina - Harpy: A Fast, Simple and Accurate Harmonic Analysis with Error Propagation](https://accelconf.web.cern.ch/ipac2022/doi/JACoW-IPAC2022-WEPOMS035.html)
    but more detail:

    - SVD, Noise cleaning, Noise estimation
    - Why numpy FFT? What about SUSSIX, LASKAR?
    - Zero padding
    - Binning
    - Error propagation
    - BPM cleaning
    - Line identification
