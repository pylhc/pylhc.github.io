# Optics Analysis

This page summarizes how the optics analysis is performed with the `measure_optics` module, from the physics point of view.
If you want to know how to **use** the `measure_optics` module through `hole_in_one`, refer to the [`omc3` analysis workflow][omc3_analysis].

!!! todo "Implement this page"
    Explain how the analysis works.
    If too long, maybe make sections their own page?
