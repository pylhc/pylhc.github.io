# Timeline of LHC Run 3 Measurements in 2025

This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2025 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Test of tools. Rephased BPMs. Confirmed local coupling corrections, measured virgin machine at injection optics and did global corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years. First attempts of total phase corrections, used the ones from 2024. First use of new Segment-by-Segment.
*[Check Coupling Through Squeeze]: Checked local coupling and local corrections at 2 m, 1.2 m, 30_60 cm and 18_60 cm (CMS $\beta$x_$\beta$y cm). While at 18_60cm, we attempted dE/E correction to no avail. We also slowly removed the triplet local corrections to see 275 % beta beating, again attempted dE/E correction to no avail. Tested Arc45 bump knobs and arc45+arc81 bump knobs. Tested effectiveness of local coupling knobs from 2024 (by reducing to 95%).
