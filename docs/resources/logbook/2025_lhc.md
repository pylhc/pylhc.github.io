# Timeline of LHC Run 3 Measurements in 2025

This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2025 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Test of tools. Rephased BPMs. Confirmed local coupling corrections, measured virgin machine at injection optics and did global corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years. First attempts of total phase corrections, used the ones from 2024. First use of new Segment-by-Segment.
