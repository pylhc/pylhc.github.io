This page provides quick access links to logbook entries of important OMC shifts or measurements done during the LHC 2024 commissioning and MDs.
Some entries (underlined) offer a tooltip when hovered, with a quick description of the important information from that entry.
The tables below can be sorted by clicking next to the column headers.

<!-- Tooltips -->

*[Injection Optics Global Corrs]: Measured virgin machine at injection optics then did global corrections and local coupling corrections. Reached similar performance as previous years.
*[30cm Local Corrs and Injection Meas]: Squeezed to 30cm and iterated on the "guessed" IR1 local correction to find a good one. Went back to injection optics for decay measurements, Dy, total phase advance corrections & f1020 corrections.
*[Injection Linear and NL Chroma]: Iteration on the global correction phase at injection, attempts at Dy correction and NL / chromatic measurements.
*[Inj. Global w/o kq5, f1020 and b5-RDT Corrs]: Iteration on the global correction, removing kq5.l2b1. Testing impact of f1020 correction on RDT, amplitude detuning, and beam lifetime. Study of octupoles and sextupoles on b5 RDT.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at 30cm - 1]: Tested old global corrs at 2m and 1.2m which work. New ones will be needed at 60cm, 30cm and 20cm. ML local corrections did good. Xing scan in IP1 to check feed-down from IR, correction overcompensates detuning.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at injection]: Measurements for b3 decay, 3Qy corrections, NL chroma, MO knobs effects & MO RDTs response to coupling, and B2 Dy correction attempts.
*[Nonlinear Corrections at 30cm - 2]: Validation of new IP1 b4 correction. IP1 sextupole corrections via crossing angle scans. Validation of b4,b3,a3 corrections via crossing angle scans and amplitude detuning measurements at flat-orbit and nominal crossing. Check of 2024 b6 correction.
*[Global Corrections in the Squeeze]: Determined global corrections at 60cm and 30cm. Re-measured for validation, good results.
*[Meas. in Ramp & Squeeze validation B1]: Measured the optics in the ramp, then down from 2m to 30cm. Beam 1 good. Beam 2 results in squeeze deviated from Friday due to an energy shift, which was fixed with a 1E-4 trim. New global corrections were determined and applied for Beam 2. Did some Kmod.
*[Squeeze validation Beam 2 and NL optics]: Validated optics from 60cm to 30cm. Some new corrections computed for 60cm. Validated K-mod at 60cm, 45cm and 30cm. Measured b4 corrections effect using flat orbit to kick as high as possible.
*[NL at Injection and Ion Cycle]: Tested MCD and MCOSX responses at Injection. Measured Ions at 1m and 50cm. Issues with K-mod.
*[Squeeze 30cm-22cm]: Squeezing down to 22cm and global corrections with K-mod and checking amplitude detuning.
*[Measurements with Beam-Beam Wires]: Measured with BB wires at 30cm. Little to no impact seen on coupling and beta-beating. Potential sextupolar RDTs impact. IR5 wire died and we dumped early.
*[Effect of higher-order contributions to octupole and decapole RDTs]: Test MQ trim. Injection decay measurement. Sensitivity to MCS. Impact of b5 and a4 on the DA and lifetime (LHCB2). MO footprint contraction (LHCB1).
*[Effect of CMS Solenoid on Optics]: Measured with CMS Solenoid at nominal and then ramped down. Measurements at 30cm end-of-MD show a large betabeat degradation compared to final commissioning validation, more than expected. Before / after ramp-down only gives a negigible difference in optics and local coupling. Detuning impact to be checked offline.
*[HL-LHC Optics Part 1]: Injection optics measured and corrected with success. Ramp was measured and went great except at 1TeV where betabeating goes over 20%. Flat-top optics measured and corrected. Great correction for B2 (incl. dispersion) using two knobs, while B1 uses only one knob but at 70% trim (due to exceeding limit of RQTL.9L7.B1), which still shows good control of betas below 10%.
*[Optics Validation after Technical Stop 1]: Validated optics after TS1 (due to Swiss grid intervention). Beta-beat within a few percent to reference measurements at the end of commissioning. Vertical dispersion significantly improved for B2. Some ampdet measurements for B2 only (B1 blew up). Written as 0.2W despite start/end times because we waited for the aperture measurements to be done.
*[Weak-strong beam-beam optics measurements]: Investigated bunches setup for no long-range (LR), with LR in IP1 and IP5 and with LR in all IPs. Lower betabeat w/o LR, similar for other scenarios. No dispersion changes. Coupling difference in omc3 but not BBsrc. Activation of wires spoild horizontal beta-beating but not vertical: SbS shows IP1 degradation but not IP5 (for bunches with and w/o LR). Looked into 3Qy and 4Qx RDTs, see logbook for details.
*[HL-LHC Optics Refinement]: Refined correction for HL-LHC injection optics. Others proceeded to ramp, loss maps, and aperture measurements. Summary link is for the whole MD in the OP logbook.
*[Ion Optics Commissioning]: Check beta-beating in ramp and flattop, good with Q5 correction. Checked crossing angle in IP8 has little to no impact on optics. Found good global correction but still too large betastart in IP2, refinement to be computed offline. Some measurements taken with IP2 crossing angles for b3 correction.
*[HL-LHC Optics Part 2]: Measurements through the squeeze, with arc bumps and global corrections from flattop. Improved beta-beating with global corrections and local arc bumps for first matchpoints. High beta-beating (>50%) for both beams during the last steps (at 1.15m/0.45m). Beam dumped during squeeze to 37cm.
*[60 Degree Optics]: Global linear beam optics corrections, chroma scans and tests with e-cloud tunes for f2002 RDT.
*[pp-Reference Commissioning]: Injection: 10% bbeat - no correction; additional data w/ and w/o MO taken. Ramp: bbeat almost 20% - no correction. Flattop and Collision: bbeat 15% - global correction -> 5%.
*[HL-LHC Optics Part 3]: Measurements and corrections through the squeeze: 84cm (ATS-Factor 3), with new arc-bumps in B1 and global corrections in B1 and B2 -> BBeat <20%. 43cm (ATS-Factor 6): Global corrections in B1 slightly above BBeat 20%, but B2 40% in Arc45 with no solution. Further squeeze not possible due to wrong rtqx2.l/r8 max current.
*[Failing IR correctors]: At 60cm: Measured compensation of lost skew quad correctors with Coliniearity Knob. Measured the effect of the phase changing knob (from IR1 to IR5). Went to 30cm then trimmed out MCOX (made BBQ worse) and tried a prepared correction, worked fine. Also trimmed out the MCSSX B1 (larger bbeat, but acceptable) and trimmed in the MCSSX B2 for compensation (could not be fully trimmed due to corrector strength limits, trimmed as much as we could and measured). Kmod at flat-orbit w/o local IR 1 corrections. Orbit changes w/ and w/o local IR1 corrections and with changes in colinearity knob. Changed Q1L1 -> Kmod. Trimmed in knob for f1020 and measured.
*[Detuning at injection for instability]: Looked into natural detuning at injection with a few kicks. Found small but non-zero detuning in both beams. Beam 2 might have second order detuning, to be looked into.
*[Optics with HV crossing plane]: Measurements only at 60/18cm, with no time for corrections. On-off momentum measurements only for B2, as ACD went faulty for B1H. Max BBeat ~20% for B1H, 5% B1V and less than 10% for B2.
