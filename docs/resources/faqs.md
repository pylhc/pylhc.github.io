    We are gradually including here different pieces of useful information, possibly from questions answered in meetings or on Mattermost, which don't really fit anywhere else as their whole page.

## MAD-X Pitfalls

`MAD-X` can sometimes be a bit tricky to work with.
This section is intended to put together some common pitfalls encountered when creating a MAD-X script.

!!! warning "MAD-X Errors"
    As a reminder, `MAD-X` ignores all the code that does not work.
    It does not raise errors or crash like other languages, which can make it difficult to identify your mistakes.
    As a reminder: each instruction should end with a semicolon and `MAD-X` will consider everything a single command until the next `;` is encountered.

### Tracking, Beam 2 and Beam 4

You might have noticed that an `lhcb4.seq` file is included in the `acc-models-lhc` repository.
There is a specific caveat for the beam 2 sequence definition that one needs to be aware in order to do tracking.

For practical reasons, the properties of all elements of the LHC are defined (in the `lhc.seq`) as if they apply to a clockwise proton beam (beam 1).
This allows a single definition for elements traversed by both beams.
Their effects on a beam with identical particle charge but running in the opposite direction (beam 2) must then be reversed inside the program, which is achieved by creating a beam with a [bv=-1 flag][madx_doc]{target=_blank} (section `7.4`).

However, in order to perform tracking for the `lhcb2` sequence the exact elements definitions are necessary, as well as a `bv` flag of 1.
This is done in the `lhcb4.seq` file.
There is no such caveat for tracking with beam 1, which is why there is no "beam 3".

!!! example "Tracking Cheatsheet"
    === "Beam 1"

        Tracking for Beam 1 does not have any caveat:

        - Load the `lhc.seq` sequence file
        - Create your beam for the `lhcb1` sequence with the `bv=1` flag
        - Slice the `lhcb1` sequence and track

    === "Beam 2"
        When tracking for beam 2, remember to:

        - Load the `lhcb4.seq` sequence file
        - Create your beam for the `lhcb2` sequence with the `bv=1` flag
        - Slice the `lhcb2` sequence and track

        !!! tip "What about model creation?"
            If analysing the tracking data with either `Beta-Beat.src` or `omc3`, one will need a model. The model **has** to have been made with the regular `lhc.seq` file, `lhcb2` sequence, and a beam with `bv=-1`.

## LSA Pitfalls

### Querying LSA is Slow

You might run into an issue with the [`pylhc.machine_settings_info`](../packages/pylhc/machine_settings_info.md) script where your query hangs for a (very) long time.
This is due to the fact that `pjlsa` will look for the beamprocess at the given time and extract *all trims* for the required knobs through this beamprocess, even though only the last trim is displayed.

!!! example "Workarounds"
    To speed up the script's runtime, try the following:

    - Do not extract knobs if you are only after the summary information (this is now default behaviour)
    - Only ask for the knobs you need (e.g. `--knobs name1 name1`), or just default ones (e.g. `--knobs default`) if you're unsure
    - Give a time range that is as small as possible using the `--start-time` and `--time` flags. This way a small trim history will be queried by `pjlsa`. For instance:

    ```bash
    python -m pylhc.machine_settings_info \
        --knobs name1 name2 \  # with real names ;)
        --start-time "2022-10-19 17:00:00.0" \
        --time "2022-10-19 17:30:00.0"
    ```

    Be aware though that if no trim for the knobs are in the defined time range, no values will be returned at all.
