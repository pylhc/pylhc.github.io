# Special Features of the KMod GUI Development

## Analyzing Tasks of the AutoTrim

Analyzing tasks are executed after the trimming task of one `KmodProcess`. 
The list of analyzing tasks can hold as many tasks as needed since they are getting executed in the background while another process is trimming. 
The results are displayed to the corresponding tab on the result panel. 
Most of the time each analyzing task represents one python script which is called from the GUI.
