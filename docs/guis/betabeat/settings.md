# Settings Window

* Settings are now all in one place (the settings-button on top).
* Entries in the settings that are lists (e.g. 'Turns' which will be `STARTTURN ENDTURN`) are given as **space-separated** values, NOT comma separated.
* Settings can be reverted as long as you do not click apply.
* Settings are applied automatically on ++okbtn++.
* Settings are reset to last applied on ++cancelbtn++.
