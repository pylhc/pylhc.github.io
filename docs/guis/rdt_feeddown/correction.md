# The Correction Tab of the RDTfeeddown GUI

This part of the GUI allows you to quantify the RDT correction predicted from a specific corrector and can then interactively correct the RDT feeddown using this prediction.

## The Tabs Explained

- [Graph](#__tabbed_1_1){.tab-link} tab: Displays the RDT feeddown data and the correction prediction graphically.

- [Response](#__tabbed_1_2){.tab-link} tab (optional): Allows you to quantify the RDT shift predicted from a specific corrector.

    **Main Features:**

    - <span class="guilabel">Load Files</span>: Load the corrector response files generated by the [Response](#__tabbed_1_2){.tab-link} tab.

    - ``Analysis File to Match``: Select the output file from the [Input](input.md){.tab-link} tab that you want to match with the corrector response.

    - <span class="guilabel" style="--guilabel-bg: #5C62D6;">Plot</span>: Plot the RDT data and the correction prediction. This will trigger a list of corrector knobs to be shown beneath the **Knob Manager** section. These will default to a value of 0. Values can be changed by entering a number and pressing <kbd>Enter</kbd> or clicking <span class="guilabel" style="--guilabel-bg: #5C62D6;">Update Knobs and Re-Plot</span>.

    Similar to the [Input](input.md){.tab-link} tab, this tab allows you to load measurement folders and reference data in the format outputted by the [OMC analysis tools](https://pylhc.github.io/packages/omc3/about.html) for results of measurements.

    **Main Features:**

    - ``Reference Folder``: Select the reference measurement folder containing the measurement data with the corrector strength applied and the reference crossing angle.

    - ``Response Folder``: Select the measurement folder containing the data with the <span class="warning-colored">same corrector strength</span> as the <span class="warning-colored">reference measurement</span> applied, and a <span class="warning-colored">different crossing angle</span> to the <span class="warning-colored">reference measurement</span> 
    !!! tip
        Will need to input the difference in crossing angle!

    - ``LHCB1 same as LHCB2 mode``: If this option is selected, the response will be calculated assuming that the corrector name is the same for both LHC beams. This is useful when the corrector name is not beam-specific.

    - <span class="guilabel" style="--guilabel-bg: green;">Find Response</span>: This button will calculate the response of the RDT to the crossing angle with the corrector strength applied. The output will be in the format that can be used in the [Graph](#__tabbed_1_1){.tab-link} tab.
