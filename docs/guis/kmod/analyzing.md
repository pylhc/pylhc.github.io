# Modulation Analysis

Any modulation's data is automatically saved in `NXCALS` and can be retrieved later for analysis.
We will briefly go over how to retrieve a previous modulation's data.
To see how to perform analysis on the data, jump to the [Analyzing Modulations](#analyzing-modulations) section.

## Retrieving Modulations

One can load a modulation from the `MODULATIONS` tab of the lower center part the GUI window, by clicking the big green `+` button, as shown below.

Clicking this button will open the `Retrieve` window.
There, select start and end times (`From` and `To` fields) between which to search for modulations and click the `FETCH KMOD` button.

A list of modulations will appear in the view below, showing for each the time of the modulation and the circuits that were modulated.
Select the desired modulations and click the `Extract` button.
