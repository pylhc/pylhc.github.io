Namely, one will see similar output files for a quantity which go as <code>get_*.out</code>, <code>get_*_free.out</code> and <code>get_*_free2.out</code>, where <code>*</code> is the calculated quantity (betas, phase, etc.). These each correspond to a variation of the calculated quantity, explained below.</p> <p>When doing our measurements, we use AC-Dipole driven excitations of the beam for a better signal-to-noise ratio in data acquisition. However, as the AC-Dipole has an effect on the beam optics functions the reconstructed optics from these measurements are the driven optics, not those of the accelerator itself. One can compensate for this deviation in different ways, which is why there are several output files for each optics quantity computed.</p> <p>Meaning of Different Output Files</p> Nomenclature Meaning <code>get_*.out</code> The optics functions without compensation, from the driven excitation data. <code>get_*_free.out</code> The optics functions compensated analytically using an equation<sup>2</sup>. <code>get_*_free2.out</code> The optics functions compensated the other way, see below. <p>In the case of the <code>get_*_free2.out</code> files, the compensation is done differently depending on the computed quantity. For some quantities (for instance for \\(\\beta\\) from phase) this uses the model values. For others (for instance the \\(f_{1001}\\) and \\(f_{1010}\\) coupling RDTs) it is a rescaling in which the model values are used indirectly.</p> <p>The method used to output the <code>get_*_free2.out</code> files is sometimes more robust as it does not rely on the existence of certain BPMs in the output (which could be missing after cleaning), and in some edge cases is more accurate<sup>1</sup>.</p> <p>Do Compare Outputs</p> <p>For debugging purposes, if the final result looks unbelievable, it might be of advantage to check the uncompensated output to rule out (or confirm) a failure in the recalibration method.</p> <ol> <li> Reaching the Sub Per Mil Level Coupling Corrections in the LHC\", <code>E.

As this decomposition is a linear transformation, the frequency analysis can be run directly on decomposed v-matrix, without having to re-compose the data into the time-domain, saving time and memory. The disadvantage is that, as we do not save the SVD matrices, there is no way to only run cleaning without frequency analysis at the moment.

Here, the average \\(\\beta\\)-function in the quadrupole is expressed in terms of the optics functions \\(\\beta_0\\), \\(\\alpha_0\\), and \\(\\gamma_0\\) at the end of the quadrupole.</p> <p>Assuming a drift space between the quadrupoles, these coordinates can then be expressed in terms of the distance of the quadrupole end to the middle of the drift-section \\(L^*\\), the minimum \\(\\beta\\)-function \\(\\beta^*\\), and \\(w\\), the offset of this minimum with respect to the center of the drift. The length \\(L^*\\) is usually obtained from the machine layout. Using the two average \\(\\beta\\)-functions in the quadrupoles, the other two variables \\(\\beta^*\\) and \\(w\\) can then be calculated. The \\(\\beta\\)-function at other elements in the drift space can then be determined by propagation.</p> <p>Compared to other methods, K-Modulation allows to infer a potential waist shift and its direction, which is not possible using the turn-by-turn based methods.

Earlier versions can analyse detuning as well, but some of the functionality described here is missing or a bit buggy, e.g. in these versions the 2D-detuning analysis was newly implemented, as well as the <code>Auto Clean</code> functionality, and the BBQ correction uses the wrong variable names. It is therefore recommended to use these or newer versions.</p> <p>The analysis of amplitude detuning data requires very accurate estimates of the natural tunes, which can be hard to find if they get lost in the BPM noise or when they are close to resonances in the spectrum. Multiple features have been implemented in python and GUI to ease the detuning analysis.</p> <p>As the main steps follow the standard optics analysis, the entries described here are mostly hints and tricks on how to optimize the analysis and only need to be applied where necessary.</p> <ul> <li> Load Data <p>       Simply load the data in the BPM panel.       Make sure you are loading the correct data and check the logbook for misfired kicks etc.       </p></li> <li> Run Spectral Analysis <p>       A bad spectral analysis can be recovered by the steps mentioned in \"Cleaning\",       but a good frequency spectrum and well found natural tunes will save you a lot of time later on.       </p><ul> <li> Small <code>tolerance</code> (\u224810<sup>\u22123</sup>) <p>       The tune tolerance (found in the <code>Tune Settings</code>) specifies in what region around the assumed natural tune (see next step, the region is \\(f\\) \u00b1 tolerance), the highest frequency line is chosen to be the natural tune.       To not accidentally capture the main tune or other excited resonances close by, the tolerance should be kept low (\u224810<sup>\u22123</sup>).       In case of large detuning (e.g. 40 \u00b7 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>\u22121</sup> \u00d7 0.016m = 6.4 \u00b7 10<sup>\u22123</sup>) or change of the AC-Dipole frequency (e.g. to adapt for tune drifts),       this could mean that the natural tune will not fall into this window anymore.       Both can be avoided using <code>Autotunes</code> and maybe adapting the tune deltas (see next step),       but can also be easily remedied in the cleaning step via the <code>Update Nattune</code> functionality.       You can check the approximate tolerance window, by using the <code>Set Window</code> button of <code>Update Nattune</code>,       which will set the markers according to the <code>Nattune</code> and <code>tolerance</code> in the <code>Tune Settings</code>,       which might differ a bit from the actual window if <code>Autotunes</code> are used.       </p> Tune settings. Approximate tolerance window, shown in blue for the horizontal and in red for the vertical tune. </li> <li> Use <code>Autotunes</code> and <code>Nat. Deltas</code> <p>       In case the tunes do not coincide with the model, e.g. due to tune-drifts, we might run into problems when using a small tolerance (see previous step) as the natural tune might now be outside of the search window.       One way to remedy that would be to also keep the model tunes up-to-date, e.g. use the exact tune values from the kick entries in the logbook.       The one thing that should be constant during the measurement process though, are the tune deltas.       The easiest way therefore, to make sure that at least the non-detuned tune is in the tolerance window, is to use the <code>Autotunes</code> in the <code>Tune Settings</code>:       If this is activated (here for <code>transverse</code> planes), the highest peak in the whole spectrum is automatically assumed to be the driven tune.       From those we can specify the difference to the natural tunes, by activating the <code>Nat. Deltas</code>, instead of the natural tunes themselves.       Now, no matter the tune drift (if the tunes are kept updated in Multiturn), the unperturbed natural tune should always be, where we expect it. Beware that the signs between the <code>Nat. Deltas</code> and Multiturn are inverted,         as Multiturn uses the \u0394 to specify the excitation frequency based on the natural tune,       while the GUI/harpy searches for the natural tune at \u0394 from the driven tune.       </p> Tune settings. </li> <li> Good Frequency Resolution (<code>TurnBits &gt; 15</code>) <p>       As the tune shift can be very small, we would want a good resolution in frequency, which can be controlled by <code>TurnBits</code>.       The standard value of <code>TurnBits</code> of <code>20</code> (leading to 2<sup>20</sup> complex coefficients, i.e. 2<sup>21</sup> spectral lines) is a good start, but can lead to excessive memory use when analysing 15\u221220 files at once.       I estimate (from experience), that with <code>19</code> turn-bits, you will need 60GB to 80GB of RAM, <code>20</code> will obviously double and <code>18</code> halve that value.       Both of these should be good values to use (see Infobox \"TurnBit Estimation\" below).       The <code>OutputBits</code> on the other hand can be smaller, as the highest line stored per \"bucket\" will keep the frequency location calculated from the higher resolution form <code>TurnBits</code>.       Therefore, even if the wrong line is selected (see step \"Small tolerance\"), the correct tune line will still be available in its bucket.       The only issue would be, if there is a resonance really close by.       A value of <code>10</code>-<code>12</code> (0.5 \u00b7 10<sup>\u22124</sup> - 10<sup>\u22124</sup> tune units) should be enough, to keep the file-size manageable and allow to open all the files simultaneously in the GUI.       </p></li> </ul> </li> <li> Check and Clean Data <p>       As mentioned before, it is of utmost importance to have clean data for the analysis as otherwise the fit will not work and yield unreasonable results.       In principle each file needs to be checked that all BPMs point to the correct horizontal and vertical natural tunes, and cleaned appropriately.       The following steps can be applied to recover the right natural tunes, if visible in the spectrum, limit error-bars and clean outliers.       </p><ul> <li> Check Time and Space for <code>NATTUNEX</code> and <code>NATTUNEY</code> <p>     For the amplitude detuning analysis, the most important factor is the correct determination of the natural tunes.     When the <code>harpy</code> frequency analysis is done, one can check the found tunes in the <code>Analysis Panel</code> in the <code>Time and Space</code> tab.     Make sure to select <code>NATTUNEX</code> and <code>NATTUNEY</code> not just the main tunes.  Be sure that the found tune shown is the natural tune and not the driven tune.      Often it is required to check only one of them at a time, to get a clearer view.     This can be easily achieved by right clicking into the data selection box on the left hand side of the plane that you want to unselect (or choosing <code>none</code>)     and then middle clicking into the chart to auto-zoom the data.     The BPMs should differ only very little in the found tune (&lt; 10<sup>\u22125</sup>), otherwise they need to be cleaned.     The following steps describe how to do that.     </p> Example of <code>NATTUNEX</code> data with outliers. Example for clean (but not perfect) <code>NATTUNEX</code> data. </li> <li> Check Frequency Chart <p>     In case of differences in the found tunes of the BPMs, the first check should always be the <code>Frequency Chart</code> in the adjacent tab of the <code>Analysis Panel</code>.     Especially, if there are clusters of found frequencies (i.e half of the BPMs agree on one frequency, the other half on another) in the <code>Time and Space Chart</code>,     this hints at resonance lines close by that are mistaken for the natural tune.     In any case, one needs to manually identify which of the lines within the selected <code>tolerance</code> (see in one of the analysis steps above) is the actual tune.     If it is not clear at first glance, compare the spectrum of the current kick with previous kicks to see the natural tune evolution with increasing amplitude.     Once the right tune is identified - or determined of being not present in the spectrum - one of the next steps can be applied.     Very helpful when trying to identify where the currently found natural tune is located in the <code>Frequency Spectrum</code>,     is to activate the <code>Resonance Lines</code> and select <code>Nat. Tune (Measured)</code>, which shows the average natural tunes of all BPMs (of the first selected analysis data).      Show the natural tune in the frequency spectrum. </p> </li> <li> Update natural tune window (where applicable) <p>     If the correct natural tune is visible in the spectrum but could not be identified properly, due to resonance lines close by or because the line lies outside of the <code>tolerance</code> window,     one does not have to repeat the analysis with adapted tunes, deltas and tolerance window, as needs to be done when using the python2 GUI,     but can use the <code>Update Lin-File</code> functionality:</p> <ul> <li> Select the BPMs you want to update.       If you want to update only one plane deselect (right click into the data selection box or choose <code>none</code>) all BPMs in the other plane.       If you want to update all BPMs in one plane, use <code>Ctrl + a</code> in the data of the plane you want to select. (Minimize the legend first...) ONLY SELECTED BPMS WILL BE UPDATED <li> Activate the <code>Natural Tune Window</code> by checking <code>show</code>.     <li> Click <code>Set Window</code> if the vertical markers are not showing.     <li> Set the markers so that the highest line they contain is the natural tune.          If there is no line for a selected BPM between the markers ( the window is <code>empty</code>), it can either throw an <code>error</code>, <code>remove</code> the bpm or <code>ignore</code> and leave the value as is.          (blue markers for the horizontal tune, red markers for the vertical tune).     <li> Click <code>Update Lin-File</code>.      How to update the natural tune in the Lin-File. </li> <li> Clean wrong BPMs (where applicable) <p>     If updating the natural tune window from the last step is not sufficient (e.g. if the tune line is hidden in noise), the respective BPMs should be removed.     Data can be manually cleaned by using the <code>Clean</code> functionality: Set the cursors around the data that you want to keep and <code>Clean</code>.     Or one can use the <code>Auto Clean</code> functionality, which removes all outliers based on a gaussian distribution of the points until all points either lie inside the given <code>limit</code> or     no points are beyond an automatically determined (by the number of points) range.     In both cases, the majority of the BPMs should already agree on the natural tune and any cleaning step can be undone, either separately in <code>X</code> and <code>Y</code> or int <code>both</code> planes.      <code>Auto Clean</code> and <code>Undo</code> example. </p></li> <li> Clean wrong Measurements (where applicable) <p>     If the measurement is just very noisy and the natural tune can not be recovered using the <code>Update Lin-File</code> or cleaning methods described above,     it might be best to remove the measurement completely.     If rigorous kicks have been performed, this might not be dramatic.     In case one plane has resulted in a nice measurement, but the other not so much, this measurement might need to be manually cleaned in the <code>Kick File</code> after optics analysis,     see in the later step.     </p></li> </li> <li> Run combined Optics Analysis <p>     After all measurements are satisfyingly cleaned, the optics analysis (<code>Get Optics</code>) can be run on all measurements combined, so that they end up all     in the same folder in the same <code>Kick File</code> (per plane).     Give the analysis a nice name, identifying what kind of measurement you are doing (e.g. <code>b1_ampdet_vertical_30cm_with_xing</code>).     </p></li> <li> Final Cleaning in Kick-Files <p>     After the optics analysis has run, the only input from it that is needed for the detuning analysis are the <code>Kick-Files</code>.     In fact, these are the only files required to be present in the folder given as input to the python <code>omc3.amplitude_detuning_analysis</code> script.     In the case discussed above, that for one kick one wants to keep one tune plane but not the other, one can now open the respective <code>kick_x</code> or <code>kick_y</code>     file and set the natural tune entry (e.g. <code>NATTUNEX</code>) for that kick to <code>NaN</code>.     That way, this tune measurement will be ignored. If you delete the whole line of the kick, you also remove the action data, which is needed to calculate the cross-term for this kick.      You would therefore also erase that datapoint, even though the measurement was fine.     </p></li> <li> Run Amplitude Detuning Analysis <p>     To run the amplitude detuning analysis, go in the <code>Optics Panel</code> to the <code>Action/Tune Tab</code> and select the <code>optics</code> analysis data.     The GUI already allows for a quick check, if the data looks okay, e.g. no immensely large error-bars, outliers, etc.     A quick and simple fit can already be performed here, with the slope being output in the logging line at the bottom.     To start the <code>python</code> analysis, click <code>Python Detuning Analysis</code>.     In the <code>Amplitude Detuning Analysis</code> window make sure that the right <code>Action Plane</code> for your kicks is selected.     Choose <code>XY</code> for the 2D/4D analysis.     Also make sure, that the tick at <code>AC-Dipole</code> is set, which will compensate the direct terms for the forced oscillations (i.e. divide the detuning by a factor of 2) in the plots.     The analysis from the GUI is usually run with BBQ correction, which can be <code>deactivated</code> by choosing this option in the <code>BBQ Filtering Method</code>     (it does not make sense to use the BBQ data without filtering first, therefore no filtering = no BBQ correction).     Clicking on <code>Start</code> runs the amplitude detuning <code>python</code> script on the current optics data and - if this is successful - also runs the plotting functions     for the results (and the BBQ, if this function was not deactivated).     This plotting is also done in <code>python</code>, resulting in <code>matplotlib</code> windows to pop up and <code>plot.ampdet_dQ*d2J*.pdf</code> files to appear in the optics result directory.     </p> The amplitude detuning analysis window. <ul> <li> With BBQ correction <p>     To account for any tune drifts of the machine during the measurement, the tune data is corrected by the data from the BBQ.     As this data is very noisy (and contains the outliers from the AC-Dipole excitation), it needs to be cleaned first.     A moving average of the given <code>Window length</code> is used determining a tune estimation over the kick timerange.     This data is extracted from timber and saved into a <code>bbq_ampdet.tfs</code> file in the optics results folder.     So in case you run the same detuning analysis again, but maybe want to modify the BBQ cleaning parameters, this data can be reused by ticking <code>Use previous BBQ</code>.     The first cleaning method <code>outliers</code> is using the same algorithm as <code>Auto Clean</code>, and requires an <code>outlier limit</code> to be set.     BBQ data deviating less than this limit from the moving average are never cleaned.     The moving average is then calculated on the cleaned data and the closest value to the kick time subtracted from the natural tune measured during the kick.     The second method <code>cut</code> allows to choose a fixed <code>cut</code> around the assumed natural tunes and data beyond that value is cleaned.     In this case also <code>Fine windowing</code> can be enabled, which performs another moving average on the now cleaned data and data-points deviating more than the <code>fine cut</code>     value are also cleaned. </p></li> </ul> </li> Quick TurnBit Estimation <p>Let's assume a small detuning of 10 \u00b7 10<sup>3</sup> m<sup>\u22121</sup> and an action increase between kicks of 0.020 \u03bcm / 20 kicks, leading to a detuning difference between two kicks of \u0394Q = 1 \u00b7 10<sup>\u22125</sup>. The frequency resolution \\(\\Delta f\\) is the inverse of the length of the turns-data (halved, as we have pairs), so 2<sup>\u2212TurnBits\u22121</sup> : <code>TurnBits = 20</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 4.8 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\) <code>TurnBits = 19</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 9.5 \\cdot 10^{-7}\\) <code>TurnBits = 18</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 1.9 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) <code>TurnBits = 17</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 3.8 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) <code>TurnBits = 16</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 7.6 \\cdot 10^{-6}\\) <code>TurnBits = 15</code>: \\(\\Delta f = 1.5 \\cdot 10^{-5}\\) We therefore need to set <code>TurnBits</code> to at least <code>16</code> to assure that we will see the change \u0394Q between kicks.</p>"},{"location":"measurements/procedures/general_checks.html","title":"General Checks","text":""},{"location":"measurements/procedures/general_checks.html#before-measuring","title":"Before Measuring","text":"<p>Here are a few checks to perform before starting measurements.

While <code>omc3</code> provides python modules to handle the different aspects of these tasks, it also provides entrypoint scripts to be called from the commandline.</p> <p>The first step in the workflow consists in a harmonic frequency analysis performed with the <code>harpy</code> module, while the second one is an optics analysis performed with the <code>measure_optics</code> module. The table below shows a general analysis workflow from BPM turn-by-turn measurements or simulation file to results, as well as the corresponding files at each step:</p> Workflow &amp; Files Turn-by-Turn BPM Data Frequency Spectra Various Lattice Optics Parameters SDDS files:  <code>*.sdds</code> TFS files: <code>*.lin[xy]</code> TFS files: <code>*.tfs</code> <p>In this page, we will go through the essential steps in preparing and performing an analysis, by going from start to finish with a simple example. In this walk-through, we will cover the use of the different entrypoints available to perform necessary steps.</p> <p>Example</p> <p>For our walk-through example, we will start from data obtained in <code>MAD-X</code> with the <code>TRACK</code> command for the 1023 turns in the LHC machine, with a scenario adapted from the 2018 configuration. Changes from the nominal scenario in your simulation could be including errors tables, orbit bumps, speculative magnet errors, additional elements etc. It is also easy for the reader to follow along if starting from measurements files.</p> Generating the Example Data <p>Here is the <code>MAD-X</code> script that will generate the example data used in this walk-through. It sets up a simple LHC configuration using files from <code>afs</code>, performs tracking and outputs a file named <code>trackone</code>. The script can be copy-pasted with a click in the top right of its box.</p> <p>For anyone without access to <code>afs</code>, you can find these files in our MESS repository, or can simply use one of your own. <pre><code>option, warn, info;\noption, echo=false, warn=false;\n\n! ----- Set up Lattice and Define the Optics ----- !\ncall, file=\"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/lhc_as-built.seq\";  ! needs AFS access\ncall, file=\"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22\";  ! needs AFS access\n\n! ----- Re-Cycle Sequence as in the Model ----- !\nseqedit, sequence=lhcb1;\nflatten;\ncycle, start=\"MSIA.EXIT.B1\";\nendedit;\n\n! ----- Create Beams ----- !\nbeam, sequence=lhcb1, particle=proton, bv=1, energy=6500, npart=1e10, ex=5.4115e-10, ey=5.4115e-10;\nbeam, sequence=lhcb2, particle=proton, bv=-1, energy=6500, npart=1e10, ex=5.4115e-10, ey=5.4115e-10;\nuse, sequence=lhcb1;\n\n! ----- Introduce Some Coupling ----- !\nCMRS.b1_sq = 0.001;\n\n! ----- Match Tunes and Chromaticities ----- !\nmatch, chrom=true;\n    global, sequence=lhcb1, q1=62.31, q2=60.32, dq1=2.0, dq2=2.0;\n    vary, name=\"dqx.b1_sq\", step=1e-07;\n    vary, name=\"dqy.b1_sq\", step=1e-07;\n    vary, name=\"dqpx.b1_sq\", step=1e-07;\n    vary, name=\"dqpy.b1_sq\", step=1e-07;\n    lmdif, calls=100, tolerance=1e-21;\nendmatch;\n\n! ----- Slice Lattice for Tracking ----- !\nslicefactor = 4;\ncall, file=\"/afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/toolkit/myslice.madx\";  ! needs AFS access\nuse, sequence=lhcb1;\nmakethin, sequence=lhcb1, style=teapot, makedipedge=false;\n\n! ----- Define Observation Points and Perform Tracking ----- !\n!

mostly done from measurement data, but can also be done on simulated tracking data. While <code>omc3</code> codes can read data from many machine formats, we will for demonstration purposes first convert our data to the LHC's SDDS binary format.</p> <p>For this <code>omc3</code> provides the <code>tbt_converter</code> entrypoint. A typical use consists in specifying the location of your turn-by-turn measurement files, the data type of said files and the location in which to write the converted <code>SDDS</code> data. The formats supported by the converter are:</p> <ul> <li>Machine formats: <code>lhc</code>, <code>iota</code> and <code>esrf</code>, or any machine using one of these.</li> <li>Simulation formats: the <code>trackone</code> and <code>ptc</code> formats from tracking data from <code>MAD-X</code> or <code>PTC</code>.</li> </ul> The <code>trackone</code> and <code>ptc</code> formats <p>What is referred to here as the <code>trackone</code> or <code>ptc</code> format is obtained by giving the <code>DUMP</code> and <code>ONETABLE</code> options to the <code>TRACK</code> or <code>PTC_TRACK</code> commands, respectively, in <code>MAD-X</code>. This way, all tracking data is written to a single file on disk, which you can feed to the <code>tbt_converter</code>. Remembering which tracking module was used is important as <code>PTC_TRACK</code> does not write in the same format as <code>MAD-X</code>'s <code>TRACK</code>.</p> <p>For our example, let us say that when setting up tracking we have asked <code>MAD-X</code> to output the data into a file called <code>trackone</code> (this is actually the default name). Using the converter to make a compatible <code>SDDS</code> file then goes as:</p> <pre><code>python -m omc3.tbt_converter \\\n    --files trackone \\\n    --tbt_datatype trackone \\\n    --drop_elements LHCB1MSIA.EXIT.B1_P_ \\\n    --outputdir .\n</code></pre> <p>Info</p> <p>When tracking in <code>MAD-X</code>, by default the start of machine will be included in the list of observation points. As we do not want this arbitrary point, we indicate to the <code>tbt_converter</code> we intend to drop it with the <code>--drop_elements</code> flag.

For this, <code>omc3</code> provides the <code>model_creator</code> entrypoint, which allows you to run a model simulation of the desired machine and output the needed files.</p> Supported Machines <p>The out-of-the-box supported machines for model creation are <code>lhc</code>, <code>ps</code> and <code>psbooster</code>, machines we work on. While the <code>skekb</code>, <code>JPARC</code>, <code>petra</code> and <code>iota</code> have accelerator classes, no model creator has been implemented for them yet. It is possible to extend this list for your machine by defining an appropriate <code>Accelerator</code> class as well as a model creator.</p> <p>In our example, we would like to compare our data to the nominal model of the 2018 LHC. Using the script to create a nominal model of the 2018 LHCB1, with the machine configuration and opticsfile used in our example, goes as:</p> <pre><code>python -m omc3.model_creator \\\n    --accel lhc \\\n    --type nominal \\\n    --year 2018 \\\n    --beam 1 \\\n    --energy 6.5 \\\n    --nat_tunes 62.31 60.32 \\\n    --modifiers /afs/cern.ch/eng/lhc/optics/runII/2018/PROTON/opticsfile.22 \\\n    --outputdir lhc_model\n</code></pre> <p>Some of these options belong to the <code>model_creator</code> itself, while others depend explicitly on the chosen machine, here the LHC. Refer to the model creator's API documentation for the list of options.</p> <p>The model creation runs a <code>MAD-X</code> scenario and outputs the relevant twiss results to the desired directory. Running <code>ls lhc_model/</code> yields:</p> <pre><code>b2_errors.tfs  error_deffs.txt      macros   twiss_elements.dat\nb2_settings.madx job.create_model.madx twiss.dat\n</code></pre> <p>What is a Model?</p> <p>As one can see, a \"model\" is essentially one or more TFS files with optics functions at BPMs (<code>twiss.dat</code>) and elements (<code>twiss_elements.dat</code>), other files being here for the user to understand or reproduce the result. Had we created a driven model, then an additional <code>twiss_ac.dat</code> or <code>twiss_adt.dat</code> file would have been created, with optics functions at BPMs while driving the beam. One can create their own models without the <code>model_creator</code> should they want to, as it only acts as a convenience wrapper.</p> <p>A <code>driven model</code> is the same as above, with also a <code>TWISS</code> taking into account the exciting effect of an AC dipole or ADT onto the optics. Creating this is easiest done with the <code>model_creator</code>, but can also be done individually with the a script installing the appropriate element into your sequence.</p>"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis.html#frequency-analysis","title":"Frequency Analysis","text":"<p>Once measurement or simulation is in the appropriate format, the first step as seen in the table above consists in a harmonic analysis of the data. To do so, <code>omc3</code> provides the <code>hole_in_one</code> entrypoint, which will perform frequency analysis of the data when provided with the <code>--harpy</code> flag.</p> <p>The script provides options involved in both data cleaning and parameter tweaking for the harmonic analysis, which is useful when you have relevant information about your measurements. To use these, refer to the <code>Harpy Kwargs</code> section of the hole_in_one API documentation.</p> <p>In our example we will leave most of these to their default values to keep the analysis simple, but ask from <code>harpy</code> to output all computed results. We will input <code>lhc</code> for the <code>--tbt_datatype</code> flag, but if you skipped the use of the <code>tbt_converter</code> you should input the type of your machine there. Running the frequency analysis then goes as:</p> <pre><code>python -m omc3.hole_in_one --harpy \\\n    --files trackone.sdds \\\n    --tbt_datatype lhc \\\n    --turns 0 1023 \\\n    --autotunes transverse \\\n    --to_write lin spectra full_spectra bpm_summary \\\n    --outputdir harpy_output\n</code></pre> Memory Requirements <p>During frequency analysis, <code>harpy</code> makes use of zero padding (with by default \\(2^{20}\\) zeros) to improve the accuracy of results. In turn, the padded arrays become consequent and, coupled with a high number of observation points, processing will require a substantial amount of RAM - well into the few GBs range for our example.</p> <p>When running on limiting hardware, one can change the amount of zero padding with the <code>--turn_bits</code> flag for <code>harpy</code>. It is important however to remember that decreasing this number will reduce the accuracy of the results, since it increases the range between detected frequencies. Refer to the hole_in_one API documentation for details that could help in determining which number to use.</p> <p>In the output directory, <code>harpy</code> will create TFS files with the results of the analysis for both good BPMs and identified bad BPMs. The filenames are determined by appending the appropriate suffixes to the entry files.</p> <p>Bad BPMs</p> <p>If given <code>bpm_summary</code> for the <code>--to_write</code> flag (which is the case by default), <code>harpy</code> will output the <code>.bad_bpms_[xy]</code> files. BPMs are determined as bad or not depending on several options from the cleaning phase. While these are given sensible defaults, one might need to tweak them manually depending on their measurement. Additionally, known bad BPMs can be given with the <code>--bad_bpms</code> flag.</p> <p>In the output files, various properties are given in column form for each observation point. Running <code>ls harpy_output/</code> yields the following result:</p> <pre><code>trackone.sdds.ampsx      trackone.sdds.freqsx\ntrackone.sdds.ampsy      trackone.sdds.freqsy\ntrackone.sdds.bad_bpms_x trackone.sdds.linx\ntrackone.sdds.bad_bpms_y trackone.sdds.liny\n</code></pre> <p>Plotting the Spectra</p> <p>The <code>omc3</code> package provides scripts and modules to quickly plot the spectra obtained from frequency analysis. To use these, refer to the Plot Spectrum API documentation.</p> Column Nomenclature <p>The <code>*.amps[xy]</code>, <code>*.freqs[xy]</code> and <code>*.lin[xy]</code> files in the harmonic analysis output are TFS files.</p> <p>The <code>*.freqs[xy]</code> files contain for each BPM in column format the frequencies of the resonance lines detected in the spectrum, for respectively the horizontal (<code>.freqsx</code>) and vertical (<code>.freqsy</code>) planes while the <code>*.amps[xy]</code> files contain the amplitudes of said resonance lines. This means in the column of a given BPM, the <code>nth</code> row in the <code>.amps[xy]</code> file corresponds to the amplitude of the resonance line located at the frequency given by the <code>nth</code> row in the column of the same name in the <code>.freqs[xy]</code> file. For illustration purposes, simplistic plotting of the horizontal spectrum (without the spectrum plotter mentioned above) from these files would go as: <pre><code>import tfs\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nampsx = tfs.read(\"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.ampsx\")\nfreqsx = tfs.read(\"harpy_output/trackone.sdds.freqsx\")\n\nfor bpm in ampsx.columns:\n    if bpm in freqsx.columns:  # safety check but no reason it wouldn't be there\n        plt.plot(freqsx[bpm], ampsx[bpm], \".-\")\n        # plt.stem(freqsx[bpm], ampsx[bpm])  # would be more accurate but might stress your system\n\nplt.setp(plt.gca(), xlabel=r\"$Q_x$\", ylabel=\"Amplitude\", title=\"Horizontal Spectrum\", xlim=(0, 0.5))\n</code></pre></p> <p>The <code>*.lin[xy]</code> files contain various data (in columns) computed for each BPM (in rows) as some summary information. Some column names are explicit: <code>BPM_RES</code> contains the determined BPM resolution, <code>CO</code> the closed orbit value at said BPM and <code>PK2PK</code> is the peak-to-peak value of oscillations registered by the given BPM. <code>TUNE[XY]</code>, <code>AMP[XY]</code> and <code>MU[XY]</code> are the detected tune, the amplitude of the tune line and the phase of the tune line for said BPM, respectively.</p> <p>The other columns describe the phase (<code>PHASE</code>), amplitude ratio (<code>AMP</code>) and frequency (<code>FREQ</code>) of the line identified by the number in the column name, where underscores represent a minus sign. Therefore, in the <code>.linx</code> file <code>FREQ01</code>, <code>AMP01</code> and <code>PHASE01</code> are respectively the frequency of the main vertical tune line in the horizontal spectrum, the ratio of this line's amplitude to that of the main horizontal line and the phase of this line. The equivalent columns in the <code>.liny</code> file are <code>FREQ10</code>, <code>AMP10</code> and <code>PHASE10</code>.</p> <p>Generally speaking, the frequency and amplitude of higher order lines is calculated using \\(m \\cdot Q_x + n \\cdot Q_y\\)  so <code>FREQ1_3</code> corresponds to \\(m = 1\\) and \\(n = -3\\) which is a decapolar line (\\(|m| + |n| = 4)\\). For more information, this paper on normal forms is a good resource.</p>"},{"location":"packages/omc3/analysis.html#optics-analysis","title":"Optics Analysis","text":"<p>Once harmonic analysis has been performed, one can move on to the reconstruction of optics quantities from computed spectra and phases. To do so, <code>omc3</code> provides the <code>hole_in_one</code> entrypoint, to be used this time with the <code>--optics</code> flag.</p> <p>In our example we will ask to use the <code>three_bpm_method</code> when reconstructing beta functions from phase advances, as the default <code>n_bpm_method</code> requires providing an error definition file which our simulation did not implement.

In our example, this means entering <code>harpy_output/trackone.sdds</code>.</p> <p>Like other entrypoints, the optics analysis provides many options on methods to use and quantities to compute.

Stages that are written in this file are assumed to be done and will be skipped. To rerun a stage, delete its entry and that of all following stages in the stages_completed.txt file and start your run anew.</p> Execution Order <p>The stages are ran independently of each job, meaning different jobs can be at different stages. For instance, if one job has all data for the <code>six_db</code> analysis already, but the others are still running on <code>Sixdesk</code>, the <code>check_sixtrack_output</code> stage will fail for these jobs but continue for the job that is ready.</p> <p>Because the stages after <code>submit_mask</code> and <code>submit_sixtrack</code> need only be ran after the jobs on <code>HTCondor</code> are completed, they will interrupt execution if previous stages have successfully finished.

It will pick up where it left as written in the stages_completed.txt file.</p> <p>Custom sixdesk envs</p> <p>While most studies should be fine with the input options given, there is the possibility to manually adapt the sixdeskenv and sysenv files before workspace initialization by using the <code>stop_workspace_init</code> flag. This will not reset automatically and one will have to remove the switch again to continue.</p> Polar Plots <p>For the creation of polar plots, the function <code>pylhc_submitter.sixdesk_tools.post_process_da.plot_polar</code> is available.
